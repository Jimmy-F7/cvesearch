## Overview

CVE Search turns raw vulnerability data into a workflow-oriented web app for research, prioritization, and operational tracking.

It combines URL-driven search, rich CVE detail pages, saved views, watchlists, alerts, triage state, project workflows, team notifications, and a conversational workspace in a single interface. The app is designed to feel closer to an analyst workstation than a simple API browser.

It also includes an optional AI layer for natural-language search, analyst-facing CVE summaries, remediation guidance, workspace digests, and workspace Q&A, with provider settings managed server-side through environment variables.

The GitHub Repos feature connects private and public repositories, scans their dependency trees for known vulnerabilities via the OSV.dev API, persists scan history in SQLite, and can automatically generate fix PRs using AI.

## Feature Set

### Search and Prioritization

- Search by CVE ID such as `CVE-2024-1234`
- Search by keyword or product
- Filter by vendor/product pair, CWE, published-since date, and minimum severity
- Sort by newest, oldest, highest CVSS, or lowest CVSS
- Copy deep links to exact search states

### Analyst Workflow

- Save reusable searches as server-persisted saved views
- Bookmark CVEs and advisories in a server-persisted watchlist
- Create alert rules, review matches in an alerts center, and schedule digest delivery for team destinations
- Track triage status, owner, tags, and notes with approval checkpoints
- Group CVEs into server-persisted projects with owners, due dates, labels, status, timeline events, per-item assignment, SLA tracking, remediation state, and exceptions
- Ask the workspace assistant questions over watchlist, alerts, projects, and saved searches

### AI Workspace

- Translate natural-language prompts into structured search filters
- Generate analyst-friendly CVE summaries and triage recommendations
- Draft remediation notes from affected products, references, and available metadata
- Build watchlist, alerts, and project digests from current workspace context
- Answer workspace questions over saved views, watchlist, alerts, and project workflow state
- Configure provider and model with server-side environment variables and per-feature overrides

### Vulnerability Detail

- CVSS score breakdown and severity badges
- EPSS lookup when a real CVE identifier is available
- Structured affected product rendering
- CWE enrichment when available
- CAPEC entries, comments, linked vulnerabilities, and references when present upstream
- Raw source payload for deeper inspection

### GitHub Repository Monitoring

- Connect private and public GitHub repositories via a personal access token
- Deep dependency scanning using the GitHub Tree API to discover dependency files across all subdirectories
- Supports npm (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`), pnpm (`pnpm-lock.yaml`), and Composer (`composer.json`, `composer.lock`)
- Batch vulnerability lookup via the OSV.dev API with CVSS v3 base score calculation
- Persisted scan snapshots per monitored repository with historical visibility in the UI
- Vulnerability detail links to internal CVE pages when a CVE alias is available
- AI-powered fix generation: analyzes the vulnerability, generates file changes, creates a branch, commits, and opens a pull request
- Heuristic fallback when no AI provider is configured (version bump to known fixed version)
- Detects existing fix PRs to prevent duplicates
- Archived and disabled repository detection with clear error messages

### Engineering Quality

- Server-rendered initial result loading
- URL-first state management
- SQLite-backed persistence for all workspace data
- Server-side API proxy with allowlisting and timeout handling
- Upstream response validation for key CIRCL payloads
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy)
- Rate limiting and request logging on every API route
- Parameterized SQL queries throughout
- Automated lint, test, and build checks in CI
- Heuristic AI fallback when no model provider is configured

## Security Model

> **This application is designed as a single-user local tool.** It does not include user authentication. Any visitor who can reach the server has full access to all features, including creating GitHub pull requests and triggering AI analysis.

If you expose this application on a network:

- **Place it behind a reverse proxy** with authentication (e.g., HTTP basic auth, OAuth proxy, VPN).
- **Do not expose it to the public internet** without an authentication layer in front.
- The session system assigns anonymous workspace sessions automatically — it provides data isolation between browser sessions, not access control.

The application applies rate limiting, input validation, parameterized SQL, and security headers, but none of these replace authentication for a multi-user or networked deployment.

Rate limiting uses in-memory state that resets on restart and identifies clients via request headers (`X-Forwarded-For`, `User-Agent`), which are spoofable without a trusted reverse proxy. For networked deployments, enforce client identity at the proxy layer.

The `data/` directory contains the SQLite database with all workspace state. Ensure your deployment does not serve this directory — Next.js does not expose it by default, but a misconfigured reverse proxy could make it downloadable.

## Current Boundaries

- Vendor-only filtering is intentionally blocked because the current upstream flow is only trustworthy when vendor is paired with product.
- Workspace data is scoped to the app session/user cookie rather than a shared organization identity system.
- AI providers are configured with server-side environment variables; there is no in-product credential management UI.
- Notification delivery currently persists in-app schedule and delivery records; external email/Slack/webhook delivery is modeled as destinations but not actually pushed to third-party services.
- GitHub monitoring requires a valid `GITHUB_TOKEN`; without one, the Repos workflow is limited to negative-path validation.
- Lock file regeneration (`npm install`, `composer update`) must be run locally after merging AI-generated fix PRs.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rupertgermann/cvesearch.git
cd cvesearch
npm install
```

Copy the example environment file and add your GitHub token:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to a GitHub PAT with the required scopes (see below).

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | For Repos feature | GitHub Personal Access Token. Classic PAT needs `repo` scope. Fine-grained PAT needs **Contents: Read and write** and **Pull requests: Read and write**. |
| `DATABASE_FILE` | No | Custom path for the SQLite database file. Defaults to `data/app.db`. |
| `AI_ALLOW_SENSITIVE_MODEL_DATA` | No | Set to `true` to disable redaction of sensitive triage notes, owners, and project metadata in prompts sent to third-party AI providers. Defaults to `false` (redaction enabled). |

### AI Configuration

To use model-backed AI features instead of the built-in heuristic fallback, configure server-side environment variables such as:

- `AI_PROVIDER` — global provider: `heuristic`, `openai`, or `anthropic`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_MODEL`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`

OpenAI requests are sent through the Responses API. The checked-in example configuration uses `gpt-5-mini` as the default OpenAI model.
Anthropic requests are sent through the Messages API. The checked-in example configuration uses `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` as the default Anthropic model.

You can also override individual flows with feature-specific variables such as `AI_SEARCH_ASSISTANT_PROVIDER`, `AI_CVE_INSIGHT_MODEL`, or `AI_DAILY_DIGEST_MODEL`. The `/settings` page shows the active configuration, prompt versions, tool registry, inventory assets, workspace import/export, and recent AI runs.

See `.env.example` for the full list of supported variables.
