# Feature Validation Playbook

## Scope

This document is the deep validation companion to `docs/test-user-journeys.md`. It covers the full user-facing feature set currently exposed by the app. Each feature entry includes:

- Entry point
- Preconditions
- User journey
- Expected result
- Verification status

## Test Date

- March 7, 2026

## Environment

- Build verification: `npm run build`
- Test suite: `npm test`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Smoke environment: `npm start -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3001`

## Verification Legend

- `Smoke-tested`: exercised end to end against the local production server.
- `Automated`: covered by the automated test suite, but not re-run manually in the browser/API smoke pass for this document.
- `Partial`: some of the flow was exercised, but not every branch or UI state.
- `Environment-dependent`: requires external credentials or upstream services to fully validate.

## Verification Summary

- `npm test` passed: 65/65
- `npm run build` passed
- `npm run lint` passed with one existing warning in `src/app/layout.tsx` (`@next/next/no-page-custom-font`)
- Route reachability was smoke-tested for `/`, `/watchlist`, `/alerts`, `/projects`, `/repos`, `/settings`, and `/workspace`
- Core CRUD and workflow APIs were smoke-tested for watchlist, triage, saved views, alerts, inventory, projects, notifications, workspace conversations, AI digest/search, and workspace export
- GitHub monitoring was only partially validated locally because a known-good GitHub repository/token combination was not available

## Environment Caveats

### GitHub Scanning and Fix PR Creation

- Live repository browsing, dependency scanning, and fix PR creation depend on valid GitHub credentials and repository access.
- In the March 7, 2026 local verification run, monitored-repo loading worked, but a live scan request returned `502` with `GitHub API error: Not Found`.
- The negative path was therefore validated, but a successful end-to-end scan plus PR flow still needs a fully provisioned GitHub test environment.

### Browser-Only Interactions

- Clipboard, download, and some visual-state interactions were validated primarily through UI inspection and underlying API behavior rather than automated browser playback.
- If stricter regression protection is needed, the next best step is to add Playwright journeys for the highest-value flows:
  1. Search to watchlist to triage
  2. Search to project workflow
  3. Workspace notifications and conversation history
  4. Repo scan happy-path with mocked GitHub responses
